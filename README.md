# C-code-on-Raspberry-Pi
I achieved an Intelligent Hardware Program. It is a course project of Advanced Programming. The size of the project is about 270 lines of code. 
what I've done are as follows:

1.Learnt how to code on Raspberry Pi

2.Achieved the program which can connect to not only infrared sensor but also temperature and humidity sensor

3.Implemented the transmission of the sensor data to the server

4.Visualized the sensor data on the OneNet website with C language

dht11.c can measure temperature and humidity, then upload the measured data.

InfraredPost.c can make infrared sensor sense the presence of human, then upload the measured signal and judge whether there is a human in front of the sensor.
